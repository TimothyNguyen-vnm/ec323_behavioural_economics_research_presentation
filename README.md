# EC323_Behavioural_Economics_Research_Presentation_Coded

This repository contains two LaTeX-coded presentations for EC323: Behavioral Economics, taught by Professor Jawwad Noor at Boston University in Summer 2025. Each presentation analyzes a seminal research paper and connects it to core behavioral theories covered in class.

## 📊 Presentations Included

### 1. Predicting Lotto Numbers
- **Paper**: *Predicting Lotto Numbers: A Natural Experiment on the Gambler’s Fallacy and the Hot-Hand Fallacy*  
  *(Suetens, Galbo-Jørgensen, & Tyran, 2016)*
- **Focus**: Investigates whether lottery players exhibit two contradictory biases—Gambler’s Fallacy (GF) and Hot-Hand Fallacy (HHF)—using real-world Danish lottery data.
- **Key Theories**:
  - Law of Small Numbers (Tversky & Kahneman)
  - Fallacy Reversal (Rabin & Vayanos)
- **Insights**: Shows that GF and HHF not only coexist in the aggregate but are positively correlated within individual players.

### 2. Salience and Taxation
- **Paper**: *Salience and Taxation: Theory and Evidence*  
  *(Chetty, Looney, & Kroft, AER, 2009)*
- **Focus**: Tests whether consumers react less to taxes when they are not salient (i.e., not included in posted prices).
- **Key Theories**:
  - Prospect Theory (Reference Dependence, Loss Aversion)
  - Context-Dependent Preferences
- **Insights**: Using field and natural experiments, the paper finds that non-salient taxes lead to significantly weaker behavioral responses, validating psychological models of limited attention.
